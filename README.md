//PROJECT DESCRIPTION

DigiRef is a responsive front-end project built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I have fetched the data of the books from a .json file through JavaScript and I have performed the operations like searching, filtering, clearing etc. with user-defined javascript functions. And, I have designed the user interface of the website with raw HTML and CSS.

It is designed to be accessed and used online, but it also has the capability to manage an offline library.

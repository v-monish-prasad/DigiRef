//PROJECT DESCRIPTION

“DigiRef” is a responsive front-end project built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I have fetched the data of the books from a .json file through JavaScript and I have performed the operations like searching, filtering, clearing etc. with user-defined javascript functions. And, I have designed the user interface of the website with raw HTML and CSS avoiding external dependencies.

//SCOPE

DigiRef provides features for managing a library's/person's book collection, displaying book availability, and filtering books based on different criteria. It is designed to be accessed and used online, but it also has the capability to manage an offline library.

//TECHNOLOGIES USED

HTML, CSS, JS

//SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Download the .zip file and extract it in a directory.
Open index.html in any of the browser to view the website.
